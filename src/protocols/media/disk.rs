/// This protocol is used to abstract Block I/O interfaces.
///
/// The `EFI_DISK_IO_PROTOCOL` is used to control block I/O interfaces.
///
/// The disk I/O functions allow I/O operations that need not be on the underlying deviceâ€™s block boundaries or alignment requirements. This is done by copying the data to/from internal buffers as needed to provide the proper requests to the block I/O device. Outstanding write buffer data is flushed by using the EFI_BLOCK_IO_PROTOCOL.FlushBlocks() function of the EFI_BLOCK_IO_PROTOCOL on the device handle.
///
/// The firmware automatically adds an EFI_DISK_IO_PROTOCOL interface to any EFI_BLOCK_IO_PROTOCOL interface that is produced. It also adds file system, or logical block I/O, interfaces to any EFI_DISK_IO_PROTOCOL interface that contains any recognized file system or logical block I/O devices. The firmware must automatically support the following required formats:
///
/// - The EFI FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 file system types.
///
/// - The legacy master boot record partition block. (The presence of this on any block I/O device is optional, but if
/// it is present the firmware is responsible for allocating a logical device for each partition).
///
/// - The extended partition record partition block.
///
/// - The El Torito logical block devices.
