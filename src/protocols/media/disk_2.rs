/// The `EFI_DISK_IO2_PROTOCOL` is used to control block I/O interfaces.
///
/// The disk I/O functions allow I/O operations that need not be on the underlying deviceâ€™s block
/// boundaries or alignment requirements. This is done by copying the data to/from internal buffers
/// as needed to provide the proper requests to the block I/O device. Outstanding write buffer data
/// is flushed by using the `FlushBlocksEx()` function of the `EFI_BLOCK_IO2_PROTOCOL` on the device
/// handle.
///
/// The firmware automatically adds an `EFI_DISK_IO2_PROTOCOL` interface to any `EFI_BLOCK_IO2_PROTOCOL`
/// interface that is produced. It also adds file system, or logical block I/O, interfaces to any
/// `EFI_DISK_IO2_PROTOCOL` interface that contains any recognized file system or logical block I/O
/// devices.
///
/// Implementations must account for cases where there is pending queued asynchronous I/O when a call
/// is received on a blocking protocol interface. In these cases the pending I/O will be processed
/// and completed before the blocking function is executed so that operation are carried out in the
/// order they were requested.
