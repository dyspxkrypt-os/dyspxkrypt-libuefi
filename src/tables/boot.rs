    /// ## Description
    ///
    /// This function raises the priority of the currently executing task and returns its previous priority level.
    ///
    /// Only three task priority levels are exposed outside of the firmware during boot services execution. The first is
    /// `TPL_APPLICATION` where all normal execution occurs. That level may be interrupted to perform various asynchronous
    /// interrupt style notifications, which occur at the `TPL_CALLBACK` or `TPL_NOTIFY` level. By raising the task priority level
    /// to `TPL_NOTIFY` such notifications are masked until the task priority level is restored, thereby synchronizing
    /// execution with such notifications. Synchronous blocking I/O functions execute at `TPL_NOTIFY`. `TPL_CALLBACK` is
    /// typically used for application level notification functions. Device drivers will typically use `TPL_CALLBACK`
    /// or `TPL_NOTIFY` for their notification functions. Applications and drivers may also use `TPL_NOTIFY` to protect
    /// data structures in critical sections of code.
    ///
    /// The caller must restore the task priority level with `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.RestoreTPL()` to the previous level
    /// before returning.
    ///
    /// **Note:** If `NewTpl` is below the current TPL level, then the system behavior is indeterminate. Additionally,
    /// only `TPL_APPLICATION`, `TPL_CALLBACK`, `TPL_NOTIFY` and `TPL_HIGH_LEVEL` may be used. All other values are
    /// reserved for use by the firmware; using them will result in unpredictable behavior. Good coding practice
    /// dictates that all code should execute at its lowest possible TPL level, and the use of TPL levels above
    /// `TPL_APPLICATION` must be minimized. Executing at TPL levels above `TPL_APPLICATION` for extended periods of
    /// time may also result in unpredictable behavior.
    ///
    /// ## Status Codes Returned
    ///

    /// returns the previous task priority level, which is to be restored later with a matching call to `RestoreTPL()`.
