//! # EFI Tables
//!
//! This module contains definitions to various tables defined by the UEFI specification.

use crate::types::{UINT32, UINT64};

/// The EFI table header is the data structure that precedes all of the standard EFI table types.
///
/// ## Notes
///
/// - The capabilities found in the system table, runtime table and boot services table may change
/// over time. The header of these tablesâ€™s `Revision` field is incremented when new capabilities and
/// functions are added to the table. When checking for capabilities, code should verify that `Revision`
/// is **greater than or equal to** the revision level of the table at the point when the capabilities
/// were added to the UEFI specification.
///
/// - Unless otherwise specified, UEFI uses a standard CCITT32 CRC algorithm with a seed polynomial
/// value of `0x04C11DB7` for its CRC calculations.
///
/// - The size of the system table, runtime services table, and boot services table may increase over
/// time. It is very important to always use the `HeaderSize` field of the header to determine the size
/// of these tables.
#[repr(C)]
pub struct EFI_TABLE_HEADER {
    /// A 64-bit signature that identifies the type of table that follows. Unique signatures have been
    /// generated for the EFI System Table, the EFI Boot Services Table as well as the EFI Runtime Services
    /// Table.
    pub Signature: UINT64,
    /// The revision of the EFI Specification to which this table conforms. The upper 16 bits of this field
    /// contain **the major revision value**, and the lower 16 bits contain **the minor revision value**.
    /// The minor revision values are binary coded decimals and are limited to the range of \[`00`, `99`].
    ///
    /// When printed or displayed, the UEFI spec revision is referred to as `(Major revision).(Minor revision upper decimal).(Minor revision lower decimal)`
    /// or `(Major revision).(Minor revision upper decimal)` in case the `Minor revision lower decimal` is
    /// set to `0`. For example:
    ///
    /// - a specification with the revision value `((2 << 16) | (30))` would be referred to as `2.3`; and
    ///
    /// - a specification with the revision value `((2 << 16) | (31))` would be referred as `2.3.1`.

    /// the 32-bit CRC for `HeaderSize` bytes.

    /// Reserved field that must be set to `0`.
